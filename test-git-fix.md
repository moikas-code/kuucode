# Git Permission Fix Test

## Test Steps

1. Start the TUI:
   ```bash
   cd /home/moika/Documents/code/kuucode
   bun dev
   ```

2. In the TUI, ask the AI to perform a git operation:
   - "Can you commit these changes with message 'Fixed TUI dialog corruption'"
   - "Can you push to git"

3. Expected behavior:
   - No "log3 is not a function" error
   - Permission request is logged (check terminal logs)
   - Operation is denied by default (safe behavior in TUI mode)
   - No terminal corruption or overlay issues

## What was fixed

The error "TypeError: log3 is not a function" was caused by:
1. The `prompts.log()` function was being called but didn't exist properly
2. Fixed by creating a hybrid export that works both as a function and an object
3. Now `prompts.log("message")` and `prompts.log.info("message")` both work

## Implementation details

The `tui-safe-prompt.ts` now exports a `log` that is both:
- A function: `prompts.log("message")` 
- An object with methods: `prompts.log.info()`, `prompts.log.error()`, etc.

This maintains compatibility with both usage patterns in the codebase.
