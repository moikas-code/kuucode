# üîÑ Kuucode Parity Tracking - Quick Start

> **TL;DR**: Run `bun scripts/parity-daily` for daily checks, `bun scripts/parity dashboard` for status

## What This Is

A comprehensive system to track and integrate valuable improvements from the upstream `sst/opencode` repository into your `kuuzuki` fork while maintaining your unique features.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **System Active**: 50 upstream commits discovered and triaged  
üîç **Pending Review**: 14 high-priority items ready for integration  
üìà **Integration Rate**: 4% (will improve as you review items)  
ü§ñ **Automation**: Weekly checks + GitHub Actions enabled

## Daily Workflow (2 minutes)

```bash
# Check what needs attention
bun scripts/parity-daily
```

This shows:

- New upstream commits
- High-priority items to review
- Current integration status

## Weekly Review (30-60 minutes)

```bash
# 1. See what needs review
bun scripts/parity list pending high

# 2. Review a specific commit
bun scripts/parity review abc123
# (Edit the generated template in kb/reviews/abc123-review.md)

# 3. Make decision
bun scripts/parity update abc123 integrated "Easy bug fix, no conflicts"
# OR
bun scripts/parity update abc123 skipped "Conflicts with kuuzuki features"

# 4. Check progress
bun scripts/parity dashboard
```
