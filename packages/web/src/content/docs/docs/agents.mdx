Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be configured for specific tasks and workflows. They allow you to create focused tools with custom prompts, models, and tool access.

## Creating Agents

You can create new agents using the `kuuzuki agent create` command. This interactive command will:

1. Ask where to save the agent (global or project-specific)
2. Prompt for a description of what the agent should do
3. Generate an appropriate system prompt and identifier
4. Let you select which tools the agent can access
5. Create a markdown file with the agent configuration

```bash
kuuzuki agent create
```

The command will guide you through the process and automatically generate a well-structured agent based on your requirements.

## Built-in Agents

kuuzuki comes with a built-in `general` agent:

- **general** - General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. Use this when searching for keywords or files and you're not confident you'll find the right match in the first few tries.

## Configuration

Agents can be configured in your `kuuzuki.json` config file or as markdown files.

### JSON Configuration

```json title="kuuzuki.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://kuuzuki.com/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "code-reviewer": {
      "description": "Reviews code for best practices and potential issues",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      "prompt": "You are a code reviewer. Focus on security, performance, and maintainability.",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false
      }
    },
    "test-writer": {
      "description": "Specialized agent for writing comprehensive tests",
      "prompt": "You are a test writing specialist. Write thorough, maintainable tests.",
      "tools": {
        "bash": true,
        "read": true,
        "write": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Markdown Configuration

You can also define agents using markdown files. Place them in:

- Global: `~/.config/kuuzuki/agent/`
- Project: `.kuuzuki/agent/`

```markdown title="~/.config/kuuzuki/agent/code-reviewer.md"
---
description: Reviews code for best practices and potential issues
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
tools:
  write: false
  edit: false
---

You are a code reviewer with expertise in security, performance, and maintainability.

Focus on:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code maintainability
- Best practices adherence
```

## Agent Properties

### Required

- **description** - Brief description of what the agent does and when to use it

### Optional

- **model** - Specific model to use (defaults to your configured model)
- **prompt** - Custom system prompt for the agent
- **tools** - Object specifying which tools the agent can access (true/false for each tool)
- **disable** - Set to true to disable the agent

## Tool Access

By default, agents inherit the same tool access as the main assistant. You can restrict or enable specific tools:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "readonly-agent": {
      "description": "Read-only agent for analysis",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false,
        "bash": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Common tools you might want to control:

- `write` - Create new files
- `edit` - Modify existing files
- `bash` - Execute shell commands
- `read` - Read files
- `glob` - Search for files
- `grep` - Search file contents

## Using Agents

Agents are automatically available through the Task tool when configured. The main assistant will use them for specialized tasks based on their descriptions.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear descriptions** - Write specific descriptions that help the main assistant know when to use each agent
2. **Focused prompts** - Keep agent prompts focused on their specific role
3. **Appropriate tool access** - Only give agents the tools they need for their tasks
4. **Consistent naming** - Use descriptive, consistent names for your agents
5. **Project-specific agents** - Use `.kuuzuki/agent/` for project-specific workflows

## Examples

### Documentation Agent

```markdown title="~/.config/kuuzuki/agent/docs-writer.md"
---
description: Writes and maintains project documentation
tools:
  bash: false
---

You are a technical writer. Create clear, comprehensive documentation.

Focus on:

- Clear explanations
- Proper structure
- Code examples
- User-friendly language
```

### Security Auditor

```markdown title="~/.config/kuuzuki/agent/security-auditor.md"
---
description: Performs security audits and identifies vulnerabilities
tools:
  write: false
  edit: false
---

You are a security expert. Focus on identifying potential security issues.

Look for:

- Input validation vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Data exposure risks
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Configuration security issues
```
