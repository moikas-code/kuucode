### Why kuuzuki?

- **Community-Driven**: Open to contributions and enhancements from the developer community
- **NPM Distribution**: Easy installation via npm, no manual binary downloads
- **Terminal-First**: Built specifically for CLI/terminal workflows
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **AI-Powered**: Integrated Claude support for intelligent coding assistance
- **Extensible**: Support for custom tools, themes, and configurations

Let's get started.

#### Prerequisites

To use kuuzuki, you'll need:

1. A modern terminal emulator like:

   - [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
   - [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
   - [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
   - [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS

2. API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

---

## Install

The easiest way to install kuuzuki is through npm.

```bash
npm install -g kuuzuki
```

You can also install it with the following:

- **Using Node.js**

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">```bash npm install -g kuuzuki ```</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Bun">```bash bun install -g kuuzuki ```</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">```bash pnpm install -g kuuzuki ```</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Yarn">```bash yarn global add kuuzuki ```</TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Build from Source

As a community-driven project, you can also build Kuuzuki from source! This gives you access to the latest features and allows you to contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/moikas-code/kuuzuki.git
cd kuuzuki

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build:all

# Run in development mode
bun run dev

# Or install globally from source
bun link
```

Building from source requires:
- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Go 1.21+ (for the TUI component)
- Git

:::tip
Building from source is a great way to contribute to Kuuzuki! You can modify the code, add features, and submit pull requests back to the community.
:::

#### Windows

Right now the automatic installation methods do not work properly on Windows. However you can grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/moikas-code/kuuzuki/releases) or build from source.

## Configure

With kuuzuki you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

We recommend signing up for [Claude Pro](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-pro) or [Max](https://www.anthropic.com/max), it's the most cost-effective way to use kuuzuki.

Once you've singed up, run `kuuzuki auth login` and select Anthropic.

```bash
$ kuuzuki auth login

┌  Add credential
│
◆  Select provider
│  ● Anthropic (recommended)
│  ○ OpenAI
│  ○ Google
│  ○ Amazon Bedrock
│  ○ Azure
│  ○ DeepSeek
│  ○ Groq
│  ...
└
```

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers and adding their API keys.

---

## Initialize

Now that you've configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that
you want to work on.

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

And run kuuzuki.

```bash
kuuzuki
```

Next, initialize kuuzuki for the project by running the following command.

```bash frame="none"
/init
```

This will get kuuzuki to analyze your project and create a structured `.agentrc` file in the project root containing your:

- Build and test commands
- Code style preferences
- Development conventions
- Tool configurations
- Custom system prompts

:::tip
The `.agentrc` file uses JSON5 format, allowing comments and more flexible syntax. You should commit this file to Git to share project context with your team.
:::

This helps kuuzuki understand the project structure and the coding patterns
used. The `.agentrc` system is a key differentiator, providing fine-grained control over AI behavior.

---

## Usage

You are now ready to use kuuzuki to work on your project. Feel free to ask it
anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might
help.

---

### Ask questions

You can ask kuuzuki to explain the codebase to you.

```txt frame="none"
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there's a part of the codebase that you didn't work on.

:::tip
Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.
:::

---

### Add features

You can ask kuuzuki to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1. **Create a plan**

   kuuzuki has a _Plan mode_ that disables its ability to make changes and
   instead suggest _how_ it'll implement the feature.

   Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You'll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.

   ```bash frame="none" title="Switch to Plan mode"
   <TAB>
   ```

   Now let's describe what we want it to do.

   ```txt frame="none"
   When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.
   Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.
   From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
   ```

   You want to give kuuzuki enough details to understand what you want. It helps
   to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.

   :::tip
   Give kuuzuki plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you
   want.
   :::

2. **Iterate on the plan**

   Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.

   ```txt frame="none"
   We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.
   [Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
   ```

   :::tip
   Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.
   :::

   kuuzuki can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can
   do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.

3. **Build the feature**

   Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to _Build mode_ by
   hitting the **Tab** key again.

   ```bash frame="none"
   <TAB>
   ```

   And asking it to make the changes.

   ```bash frame="none"
   Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
   ```

---

### Make changes

Unlike other AI tools that only provide suggestions, kuuzuki can actually build and modify your project directly. It has full access to your file system and can:

- **Write code**: Create new files, modify existing ones
- **Run commands**: Execute build scripts, run tests, install dependencies
- **Refactor**: Update multiple files in a coordinated way
- **Debug**: Run your code and fix issues it finds

For example, you can ask kuuzuki to implement features:

```txt frame="none"
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this is
handled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implement
the same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

Kuuzuki will:
1. Analyze the existing authentication pattern
2. Write the new code following the same pattern
3. Update any related files (routes, tests, etc.)
4. Run your tests to ensure nothing breaks

:::tip
Kuuzuki respects your `.agentrc` configuration, so it will follow your project's coding standards, run your specific build commands, and adhere to your development practices.
:::

You want to make sure you provide context about what you want, and kuuzuki will handle the implementation details.

---

## Share

The conversations that you have with kuuzuki can be [shared with your
team](/docs/share).

```bash frame="none"
/share
```

This'll create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

:::note
Conversations are not shared by default. Sharing requires explicit action to protect your privacy.
:::

Shared conversations will be hosted on kuuzuki.com once the domain is active.

## Kuuzuki Pro

Kuuzuki is free and open source! The only feature that requires a subscription is:

### Pro Feature:
- **Share Sessions** - Create public links to share your AI conversations (requires server infrastructure)

### Everything Else is Free:
- Terminal UI (TUI) interface
- All built-in tools (file operations, search, web fetch, etc.)
- All AI provider integrations (bring your own API key)
- IDE integrations
- CLI commands and automation
- Agent creation and customization
- GitHub integration
- MCP server integration
- Self-hosting capabilities

The share feature requires a subscription because it needs server infrastructure to host shared conversations. Everything else runs locally on your machine.
