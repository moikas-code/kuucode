import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

[**kuucode**](/) is an AI coding agent built for the terminal.

Let's start by installing kuucode.

---

## Install

The easiest way to install kuucode is through the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://kuucode.ai/install | bash
```

You can also install it with the following:

- **Using Node.js**

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">```bash npm install -g kuucode-ai ```</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Bun">```bash bun install -g kuucode-ai ```</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">```bash pnpm install -g kuucode-ai ```</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Yarn">```bash yarn global add kuucode-ai ```</TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- **Using Homebrew on macOS**

  ```bash
  brew install moikas-code/tap/kuucode
  ```

- **Using Paru on Arch Linux**

  ```bash
  paru -S kuucode-bin
  ```

#### Windows

Right now the automatic installation methods do not work properly on Windows. However you can grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/moikas-code/kuucode/releases).

## Configure

With kuucode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

We recommend signing up for [Claude Pro](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-pro) or [Max](https://www.anthropic.com/max), it's the most cost-effective way to use kuucode.

Once you've signed up, run `kuucode auth login` and select Anthropic.

```bash
$ kuucode auth login

┌  Add credential
│
◆  Select provider
│  ● Anthropic (recommended)
│  ○ OpenAI
│  ○ Google
│  ○ Amazon Bedrock
│  ○ Azure
│  ○ DeepSeek
│  ○ Groq
│  ...
└
```

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers and add their API keys.

---

## Initialize

Now that you've configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that
you want to work on.

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

And run kuucode.

```bash
kuucode
```

Next, initialize kuucode for the project by running the following command.

```bash frame="none"
/init
```

This will get kuucode to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in
the project root.

:::tip
You should commit your project's `AGENTS.md` file to Git.
:::

This helps kuucode understand the project structure and the coding patterns
used.

---

## Usage

You are now ready to use kuucode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it
anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might
help.

---

### Ask questions

You can ask kuucode to explain the codebase to you.

```txt frame="none"
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there's a part of the codebase that you didn't work on.

:::tip
Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.
:::

---

### Add features

You can ask kuucode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1. **Create a plan**

   kuucode has a _Plan mode_ that disables its ability to make changes and
   instead suggest _how_ it'll implement the feature.

   Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You'll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.

   ```bash frame="none" title="Switch to Plan mode"
   <TAB>
   ```

   Now let's describe what we want it to do.

   ```txt frame="none"
   When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.
   Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.
   From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
   ```

   You want to give kuucode enough details to understand what you want. It helps
   to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.

   :::tip
   Give kuucode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you
   want.
   :::

2. **Iterate on the plan**

   Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.

   ```txt frame="none"
   We'd like to design this new screen using the design we are already using.
   There's an example of a list of notes in @packages/web/src/components/NoteList.tsx
   ```

3. **Build the feature**

   Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to _Build mode_ by
   hitting the **Tab** key again.

   ```bash frame="none"
   <TAB>
   ```

   And asking it to make the changes.

   ```bash frame="none"
   Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
   ```

---

### Make changes

For more straightforward changes, you can ask kuucode to directly build it
without having to review the plan first.

```txt frame="none"
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this is
handled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implement
the same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so kuucode makes the right
changes.

---

## Share

The conversations that you have with kuucode can be [shared with your
team](/docs/share).

```bash frame="none"
/share
```

This'll create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

:::note
Conversations are not shared by default.
:::

Here's an [example conversation](https://kuucode.ai/s/4XP1fce5) with kuucode.

## Customize

And that's it! You are now a pro at using kuucode.

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/docs/themes), [customizing the keybinds](/docs/keybinds), or playing around with the [kuucode config](/docs/config).
