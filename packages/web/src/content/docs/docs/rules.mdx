description: Set custom instructions for kuuzuki.
---

You can provide custom instructions to kuuzuki by creating a `.agentrc` file. This is a structured JSON configuration that replaces the previous `AGENTS.md` format, providing machine-readable project information that helps AI agents understand your codebase better.

---

## Initialize

To create a new `.agentrc` file, you can run the `/init` command in kuuzuki.

:::tip
You should commit your project's `.agentrc` file to Git.
:::

This will scan your project and all its contents to understand what the project is about and generate a structured `.agentrc` file. This helps kuuzuki to navigate the project better and understand your development workflow.

If you have an existing `.agentrc` file, this will improve it. If you have a legacy `AGENTS.md` file, it will convert the content to the new structured format.

---

## Example

You can also create this file manually. Here's an example `.agentrc` file for a monorepo project:

```json title=".agentrc"
{
  "project": {
    "name": "SST v3 Monorepo Project",
    "type": "typescript-monorepo",
    "description": "SST v3 monorepo with TypeScript and bun workspaces",
    "structure": {
      "packages": ["functions", "core", "web"],
      "mainEntry": "sst.config.ts"
    }
  },
  "commands": {
    "build": "bun run build",
    "test": "bun test",
    "dev": "bun run dev",
    "deploy": "sst deploy"
  },
  "codeStyle": {
    "language": "typescript",
    "formatter": "prettier",
    "importStyle": "esm"
  },
  "tools": {
    "packageManager": "bun",
    "runtime": "bun",
    "framework": "sst"
  },
  "paths": {
    "src": "packages",
    "config": ".",
    "infra": "infra"
  },
  "rules": [
    "Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled",
    "Shared code goes in packages/core/ with proper exports configuration",
    "Functions go in packages/functions/",
    "Infrastructure should be split into logical files in infra/",
    "Import shared modules using workspace names: @my-app/core/example"
  ]
}
```

This structured format makes it easy for AI agents to understand your project setup and follow your team's conventions.

---

## Types

kuuzuki supports reading `.agentrc` files from multiple locations for different purposes.

### Project

Project-specific `.agentrc` files are placed in the project root and apply when working in that directory or its sub-directories. These contain project-specific configuration like build commands, code style, and team conventions.

### Global

You can also have global configuration in `~/.config/kuuzuki/.agentrc`. This applies across all kuuzuki sessions and typically contains personal preferences and global development standards.

Since this isn't committed to Git or shared with your team, we recommend using this to specify any personal rules that the LLM should follow.

---

## Precedence

When kuuzuki starts, it looks for:

1. **Local files** by traversing up from the current directory to find `.agentrc`
2. **Global file** by checking `~/.config/kuuzuki/.agentrc`
3. **Legacy support** for existing `AGENTS.md` files

If you have both global and project-specific configurations, kuuzuki will merge them with project-specific settings taking precedence.

---

## Custom Instructions

You can specify additional instruction files in your `kuuzuki.json` or the global `~/.config/kuuzuki/config.json`. This allows you to include existing documentation alongside your structured `.agentrc` configuration.

Example:

```json title="kuuzuki.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://kuuzuki.com/config.json",
  "instructions": ["CONTRIBUTING.md", "docs/guidelines.md", ".cursor/rules/*.md"]
}
```

All instruction files are combined with your `.agentrc` configuration and any legacy `AGENTS.md` files.

## Referencing External Files

## Advanced Configuration

### Using kuuzuki.json for Additional Instructions

The recommended approach for including additional documentation is to use the `instructions` field in `kuuzuki.json`:

```json title="kuuzuki.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://kuuzuki.com/config.json",
  "instructions": ["docs/development-standards.md", "test/testing-guidelines.md", "packages/*/.agentrc"]
}
```

### Structured vs. Unstructured Content

- **`.agentrc`**: Use for structured, machine-readable configuration (commands, tools, conventions)
- **`instructions`**: Use for detailed documentation, guidelines, and prose explanations
- **Legacy `AGENTS.md`**: Automatically converted to structured format when possible

### Migration from AGENTS.md

If you have existing `AGENTS.md` files:

1. **Automatic**: Run `/init` to convert them to `.agentrc` format
2. **Manual**: Extract structured data (commands, tools) to `.agentrc` and keep prose in separate instruction files
3. **Hybrid**: Keep both during transition - kuuzuki will merge them appropriately

:::tip
For monorepos or projects with shared standards, using `kuuzuki.json` with glob patterns (like `packages/*/.agentrc`) allows each package to have its own configuration while maintaining consistency.
