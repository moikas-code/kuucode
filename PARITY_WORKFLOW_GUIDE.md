# 🔄 How to Get New Tasks with Enhanced Fork-Parity MCP

## 🎯 **Automated Task Discovery**

The enhanced MCP automatically discovers new upstream commits and creates actionable tasks for you. Here's how it works:

### **1. Continuous Monitoring**

```bash
# Sync with upstream and analyze new commits
fork_parity_sync_and_analyze(repository_path: "/home/moika/Documents/code/kuucode")
```

This command:

- Fetches latest changes from `upstream/dev`
- Analyzes new commits since your last sync
- Applies smart triage rules to categorize them
- Updates your task queue with actionable items

### **2. Daily Task Check**

```bash
# Get your daily action items
fork_parity_get_actionable_items(priority_filter: "high", limit: 10)
```

This shows you:

- **High-priority commits** that need immediate attention
- **Security fixes** that should be reviewed quickly
- **TUI improvements** valuable for kuucode
- **Core changes** requiring careful evaluation

### **3. Weekly Batch Analysis**

```bash
# Analyze all new commits from the past week
fork_parity_batch_analyze_commits(commit_range: "master..upstream/dev")
```

This provides:

- **Comprehensive analysis** of all new upstream activity
- **Smart categorization** by priority and effort
- **Conflict risk assessment** for each commit
- **Batch summary** with actionable recommendations

## 📅 **Recommended Workflow**

### **Daily (2-3 minutes)**

```bash
# Morning check - what needs attention today?
fork_parity_get_actionable_items(priority_filter: "high")

# Quick dashboard view
fork_parity_generate_dashboard(format: "text")
```

### **Weekly (30-60 minutes)**

```bash
# Comprehensive sync and analysis
fork_parity_sync_and_analyze()

# Review all new items
fork_parity_get_actionable_items(limit: 20)

# Deep dive on important commits
fork_parity_advanced_analysis(hash, analysis_types: ["dependency", "security", "performance"])
```

### **Monthly (2-3 hours)**

```bash
# Full status review
fork_parity_get_detailed_status()

# Generate comprehensive dashboard
fork_parity_generate_dashboard(format: "markdown")

# Plan integration efforts
fork_parity_migration_plan(commit_hashes: ["hash1", "hash2", "hash3"])
```

## 🤖 **Automated Task Generation**

### **Smart Triage Rules Create Tasks**

The MCP automatically creates different types of tasks based on commit analysis:

**Skip Tasks** (Auto-handled)

- Documentation changes → Automatically skipped
- VSCode extensions → Automatically skipped
- CI/CD changes → Automatically skipped

**Auto-Integration Tasks** (Low effort)

- Typo fixes → Ready for automatic integration
- Dependency updates → Ready with testing

**Draft PR Tasks** (Medium effort)

- TUI features → Create draft PR for review
- Security fixes → Prioritized draft PR
- Core changes → Careful review required

**Manual Review Tasks** (High effort)

- Complex changes → Detailed analysis needed
- Breaking changes → Migration planning required

### **Task Prioritization**

Tasks are automatically prioritized:

**Critical** 🚨

- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes affecting core functionality

**High** ⚠️

- TUI improvements valuable for kuucode
- Core functionality enhancements
- Performance improvements

**Medium** 📋

- Bug fixes in relevant areas
- Feature additions that might be useful

**Low** 📝

- Minor improvements
- Refactoring that doesn't affect functionality

## 🔔 **Notification System**

### **Automated Alerts**

Configure notifications to get tasks delivered to you:

```bash
# Set up Discord notifications
fork_parity_setup_notifications(channels: [
  {
    "type": "discord",
    "config": {
      "webhook": "your-discord-webhook-url"
    }
  }
])
```

**Notification Types:**

- **Daily Summary**: Morning digest of new high-priority items
- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate notification for security issues
- **Integration Updates**: Status of auto-integrated changes
- **Weekly Reports**: Comprehensive analysis summary

### **GitHub Actions Integration**

Set up automated workflows:

```bash
# Configure automated daily checks
fork_parity_setup_github_actions(workflows: {
  "daily_sync": true,
  "critical_alerts": true,
  "pr_checks": true,
  "security_scans": true
})
```

This creates:

- **Daily sync workflow** that runs every morning
- **Critical alert workflow** for security issues
- **PR integration workflow** for automated changes
- **Security scan workflow** for dependency updates

## 📊 **Task Dashboard**

### **Real-Time Status**

```bash
# See all your current tasks
fork_parity_generate_dashboard(format: "markdown")
```

**Dashboard Shows:**

- **Total pending tasks** by priority
- **Integration progress** over time
- **Conflict risk assessment** for pending items
- **Effort estimates** for planning
- **Success metrics** and trends

### **Actionable Insights**

```bash
# Get specific recommendations
fork_parity_get_actionable_items(priority_filter: "medium", limit: 5)
```

**Each Task Includes:**

- **Commit hash** and message
- **Priority level** and reasoning
- **Effort estimate** (trivial to XL)
- **Conflict risk** percentage
- **Recommended action** (auto, draft-pr, manual)

## 🎯 **Example Daily Workflow**

### **Morning Routine (5 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Check for new high-priority tasks
fork_parity_get_actionable_items(priority_filter: "high")

# 2. Quick status overview
fork_parity_generate_dashboard(format: "text")

# 3. Sync with upstream if needed
fork_parity_sync_and_analyze()
```

### **Weekly Planning (30 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Comprehensive analysis of new commits
fork_parity_batch_analyze_commits(commit_range: "master..upstream/dev")

# 2. Review medium-priority items
fork_parity_get_actionable_items(priority_filter: "medium", limit: 10)

# 3. Plan integration efforts
fork_parity_migration_plan(commit_hashes: ["important", "commits"])
```

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Customize Your Workflow**

Edit `.parity-integration.json` to adjust:

- **Rule priorities** based on your preferences
- **Notification settings** for your workflow
- **Automation levels** for different commit types
- **Integration thresholds** for auto-processing

## 📈 **Continuous Improvement**

The system learns and improves over time:

- **Success tracking** improves rule accuracy
- **Conflict analysis** refines risk assessment
- **Integration patterns** optimize automation
- **Team feedback** enhances categorization

**Your task queue will continuously grow** as the MCP discovers new upstream commits and intelligently categorizes them for your review and action! 🎯
