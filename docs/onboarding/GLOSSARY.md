# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Kuucode project.

## üéØ Core Terms

### **Agent**

An AI-powered assistant that can understand natural language instructions and perform coding tasks. Kuucode is an AI coding agent.

### **API**

Application Programming Interface. In Kuucode, refers to the REST API provided by the TypeScript server that clients (like the TUI) use to communicate.

### **Bubble Tea**

A Go framework for building terminal user interfaces. Used by Kuucode's TUI component for creating the interactive terminal experience.

### **Bun**

A fast JavaScript runtime and package manager. Kuucode uses Bun instead of Node.js for better performance and developer experience.

### **Client**

Any application that connects to the Kuucode server. Examples include the TUI, VS Code extension, or web clients.

### **Context**

Information about the current project, files, and environment that helps the AI provide better assistance. Includes file structure, Git status, LSP data, etc.

## üîß Technical Terms

### **Hono**

A lightweight web framework for TypeScript/JavaScript. Kuucode uses Hono for its HTTP server instead of Express.

### **LSP (Language Server Protocol)**

A protocol that provides language features like autocomplete, diagnostics, and hover information. Kuucode integrates with LSPs to understand code better.

### **OpenAPI Generator**

An open-source tool that generates client SDKs from OpenAPI specifications. Replaced Stainless in Kuucode for cost savings and independence.

### **Provider**

An AI service integration (like Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, or local models). Providers implement a common interface for text generation.

### **SDK (Software Development Kit)**

Client libraries generated from the API specification. Kuucode generates TypeScript, Go, and Python SDKs.

### **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

A web standard for streaming real-time data from server to client. Used for streaming AI responses in real-time.

### **Stainless**

A commercial service for generating SDKs from API specifications. Previously used by Kuucode but replaced with OpenAPI Generator.

### **Streaming**

The process of sending data in chunks as it becomes available, rather than waiting for the complete response. Enables real-time AI response display.

### **TUI (Terminal User Interface)**

A text-based user interface that runs in a terminal. Kuucode's primary interface is a TUI built with Go and Bubble Tea.

## üé® UI Terms

### **Component**

A reusable UI element in the TUI. Examples include chat components, file viewers, and status bars.

### **Focus**

Which UI component is currently active and receiving keyboard input.

### **Layout**

How UI components are arranged on screen. Can be responsive based on terminal size.

### **Modal**

A dialog box that appears over the main interface, requiring user interaction before continuing.

### **Theme**

A set of colors and styling rules that define the visual appearance of the TUI.

### **Viewport**

The visible area of content, especially for scrollable components like chat history or file lists.

## üîÑ Workflow Terms

### **Chat**

A conversation between the user and AI within a session. Similar to a chat conversation in messaging apps.

### **Message**

A single exchange in a chat. Can be from the user, AI assistant, or system (for tool calls).

### **Session**

A persistent conversation thread with the AI. Sessions maintain context and can be resumed across app restarts.

### **Tool Call**

When the AI decides to use a tool (like editing a file or running a command) to accomplish a task.

### **Tool**

A capability that the AI can use to interact with the system. Examples include file editing, shell commands, and code search.

## üìä Data Terms

### **Configuration**

Settings that control how Kuucode behaves. Can be global, project-specific, or session-specific.

### **Credentials**

Authentication information like API keys for AI providers.

### **Metadata**

Additional information about messages, sessions, or other data objects.

### **Persistence**

Storing data (like sessions and messages) so they survive app restarts.

### **Schema**

A definition of the structure and validation rules for data objects.

## üîå Integration Terms

### **Authentication**

The process of verifying identity, typically using API keys or OAuth tokens for AI providers.

### **Git Integration**

Features that make Kuucode aware of Git repository status, changes, and history.

### **Model**

A specific AI model from a provider (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4).

### **OAuth**

An authentication protocol used by some AI providers for secure access.

### **Project Context**

Information about the current project including file structure, Git status, and recent changes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Terms

### **Client-Server Architecture**

A design where the TUI (client) communicates with a separate server process for business logic.

### **Event-Driven**

A programming pattern where components react to events (like keyboard input or API responses).

### **Middleware**

Code that processes HTTP requests before they reach the main handler. Used for authentication, logging, etc.

### **REST API**

A web API design pattern using HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for different operations.

### **Stateless**

A design where the server doesn't maintain client state between requests. Each request contains all needed information.

## üîß Development Terms

### **Hot Reload**

Automatically restarting the application when code changes are detected during development.

### **Monorepo**

A repository containing multiple related packages. Kuucode uses a monorepo structure with packages for server, TUI, web, etc.

### **Package Manager**

A tool for managing dependencies. Kuucode uses Bun as its package manager.

### **Type Checking**

Verifying that TypeScript code uses types correctly. Done with `bun run typecheck`.

### **Workspace**

A collection of related packages managed together. Defined in the root package.json.

## üöÄ Deployment Terms

### **Binary**

A compiled executable file. The TUI is compiled to a binary for distribution.

### **Build**

The process of compiling and preparing code for distribution.

### **CI/CD**

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. Automated testing and deployment processes.

### **Release**

A versioned distribution of the software with specific features and bug fixes.

## üìù File Types

### **`.go`**

Go source code files. Used for the TUI component.

### **`.ts`**

TypeScript source code files. Used for the server component.

### **`.json`**

JavaScript Object Notation files. Used for configuration and data.

### **`.md`**
